How to play BLACKJACK:

dealer deals 2 cards to each player and 2 to himself, one is face down.

The players look at their cards

  If the 2 cards add up to 21:

   {say "Blackjack" to end the game}

  Else:

   {begin the game normally}
   
The dealer asks the player to hit or stand.
  
  If the player chooses to hit:

    dealer gives the player 1 card faced down
    
  The player looks at their cards again

  If the player's cards add up to 21:

    The player wins the game

  If the player's cards add up to above 21:

    The player is eliminated

  Else:

    Continue the game normally
    
The dealer deals out cards for the next player


  Else if the person stands:


    Player keeps the same cards

    Continue to the next player

after everyone stands or is eliminated:

dealer looks at his cards

if his cards add up to less than 17:
he hits,
repeat until 17 or more

check if each player has more than the dealer, if they do they win.

repeat game as much as player wants to play.
